Things to do:
1. Change excel file (file modified - Distances tab to csv file) X For now we don't save the distances, maybe create a distance database in the future
2. Clean excel file (file modified DA - State tab) - make change in python. Use code from line 24 - 27 from 3rd step python code X Done, when uploading dictionnaries we remove duplicates
3. Modify step 3 from 'Tool Computing Steps' below
4. Merge all python files into 1 file and call other files using exec function X Work in progress, so far up to step 2 has been done, Next step is creating list of useful Da based on optimization results and run full scale optimization
5. Regression on Line Haul Pricing


Tool Computing Steps:
1. Compute distances for non-zero volume postal codes to DAs
2. Last Mile Optimization 
3. Recompute new distances without usless DAs using HomeDepot distance calculator (excel built-in tool) - pause python 
4. Full Optimization (Last Mile + Line haul)
5. Compute distances for 0 volume postal codes with DAs used from step 4
6. Last mile optimization for 0 volum postal codes with DAs from step 4
7. Further modification base on user inputs - may use cost analysis methods
