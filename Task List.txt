Things to do:
1. Change excel file (file modified - Distances tab to csv file)
2. Clean excel file (file modified DA - State tab) - make change in python. Use code from line 24 - 27 from 3rd step python code
3. Modify step 3 from 'Tool Computing Steps' below
4. Merge all python files into 1 file and call other files using exec function
5. Regression on Line Haul Pricing


Tool Computing Steps:
1. Compute distances for non-zero volume postal codes to DAs
2. Last Mile Optimization 
3. Recompute new distances without usless DAs using HomeDepot distance calculator (excel built-in tool) - pause python 
4. Full Optimization (Last Mile + Line haul)
5. Compute distances for 0 volume postal codes with DAs used from step 4
6. Last mile optimization for 0 volum postal codes with DAs from step 4
7. Further modification base on user inputs - may use cost analysis methods
